(-9 for the manual run of this type: all 3 make toys with contract violations)

TA Comments on Design for q1:-
- Incorrect contract for after-key-event, should return a World not Widget
- big-bang implementation looks good
- Incorrect template for Politician% 

Suggestions:-
- Unnecessary call for after-key-event to implementations of Toy, could have returned this in meta-toy
- Could have generalized x-after-drag and y-after-drag functions in Throbber

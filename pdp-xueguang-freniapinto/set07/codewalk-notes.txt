TA Comments on Design for q1:-
- program and list of definitions are the same, then why 2 templates
- ident variable was not required for header i.e. could have used in the body
- could have used constant as INITIAL-INDENT instead of 4
- list-of-var-to-string has an invariant for non-empty list but has a check for empty
- contract for lambda is missing in list-of-var-to-string
- argument-to-string has incomplete contract i.e. the function takes in 5 arguments

TA Comments on Design for q2:-
-  Strategy for axis-move-forward is incorrect. i.e. should be using template for Range
-  Overall design was good.
